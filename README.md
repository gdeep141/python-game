# python-game
'Doodle Jump' type platformer game.

To run:
* Install pygame
* Ensure the files 'main.py', 'sprites.py', 'settings.py' are all in the same directory
* Ensure the directories 'img' and 'sound' are in the same directory as the above files
* Run 'main.py'

Worked on collaboratively with Robert Thurston.
